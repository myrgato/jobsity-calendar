## Introduction

Interview Test for Jobsity - Reminder Calendar

**Mandatory Features**

> All of those below are included in the project

- Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

- Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.

- Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.

- Ability to edit reminders â€“ including changing text, city, day, time and color.

- Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.

> Note that the Open Weather free API only gives us five days from now of forecasts, so any date before or after won't show weather information

- Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

> Includes also tests for deleting, deleting all, editing and E2E tests with Cypress.

**Bonus Features**

- Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.

> There's a top area part with buttons to go to previous or next month and jump back to today.

> It features all months and years.

- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.

> Reminders are grouped by time.

- Functionality to delete one or ALL the reminders for a specific day

> Both actions are included

The project also features `localstorage` integration via `redux-persist`.
